        * cdl/flash_integrator.cdl:
        Don't implement CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_DEVICE here. Leave it for
        the chip driver.

2002-03-06  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* cdl/flash_integrator.cdl: Converted to use generic 28Fxxx flash
	driver.

	* src/arm_integrator_flash.c: 
	This file added to parameterize generic FLASH driver. Also define
	here CYGHWR_FLASH_WRITE_ENABLE() and CYGHWR_FLASH_WRITE_DISABLE()
	to turn FLASH writing on and off.

	* src/flash.h:
	* src/flash_erase_block.c:
	* src/flash_program_buf.c:
	* src/flash_query.c:
	Files removed. These are the old flash driver.
