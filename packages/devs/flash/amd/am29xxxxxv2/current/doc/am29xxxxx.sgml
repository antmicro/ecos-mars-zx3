    <para>
The <varname>CYGPKG_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX_V2</varname> AMD
AM29xxxxx V2 flash driver package implements support for the AM29xxxxx
family of flash devices and compatibles. Normally the driver is not
accessed directly. Instead application code will use the API provided
by the generic flash driver package
<varname>CYGPKG_IO_FLASH</varname>, for example by calling functions
like <function>cyg_flash_program</function>.
    </para>
    <para>
The driver imposes one restriction on application code which
developers should be aware of: when programming the flash the
destination addresses must be aligned to a bus boundary. For example
if the target hardware has a single flash device attached to a 16-bit
bus then program operations must involve a multiple of 16-bit values
aligned to a 16-bit boundary. Note that it is the bus width that
matters, not the device width. If the target hardware has two 16-bit
devices attached to a 32-bit bus then program operations must still be
aligned to a 32-bit boundary, even though in theory a 16-bit boundary
would suffice. In practice this is rarely an issue, and requiring the
larger boundary greatly simplifies the code and improves performance.
    </para>
    <note><para>
Many eCos targets with AM29xxxxx or compatible flash devices will
still use the older driver package
<varname>CYGPKG_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX</varname>. Only newer ports
and some older ports that have been converted will use the V2 driver.
This documentation only applies to the V2 driver.
    </para></note>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1 id="am29xxxxx-config"><title>Configuration Options</title>
    <para>
The AM29xxxxx flash driver package will be loaded automatically when
configuring eCos for a target with suitable hardware. However the
driver will be inactive unless the generic flash package
<varname>CYGPKG_IO_FLASH</varname> is loaded. It may be necessary to
add this generic package to the configuration explicitly before the
driver functionality becomes available. There should never be any need
to load or unload the AM29xxxx driver package.
    </para>
    <para>
There are a number of configuration options, relating mostly to hardware
characteristics. It is very rare that application developers need to
change any of these. For example the option
<varname>CYGNUM_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX_V2_ERASE_REGIONS</varname>
may need a non-default value if the flash devices used on the target
have an unusual boot block layout. If so the platform HAL will impose
a requires constraint on this option and the configuration system will
resolve the constraint. The only time it might be necessary to change
the value manually is if the actual board being used is a variant of
the one supported by the platform HAL and uses a different flash chip.

  <refsect1 id="am29xxxxx-instance-description"><title>Description</title>
    <para>
The AM29xxxxx family contains some hundreds of different flash
devices, all supporting the same basic set of operations but with
various common or uncommon extensions. The devices vary in capacity,
performance, boot block layout, and width. There are also
platform-specific issues such as how many devices are actually present
on the board and where they are mapped in the address space. The
AM29xxxxx driver package cannot know the details of every chip and
every platform. Instead it is the responsibility of another package,
usually the platform HAL, to supply the necessary information by
instantiating some data structures. Two pieces of information are
especially important: the bus configuration and the boot block layout.
    </para>
    <para>
Flash devices are typically 8-bits, 16-bits, or 32-bits wide (64-bit
devices are not yet in common use). Most 16-bit devices will also
support 8-bit accesses, but not all. Similarly 32-bit devices can be
accessed 16-bits at a time or 8-bits at a time. A board will have one
or more of these devices on the bus. For example there may be a single
16-bit device on a 16-bit bus, or two 16-bit devices on a 32-bit bus.
The processor's bus logic determines which combinations are possible,
and there will be a trade off between cost and performance: two 16-bit
devices in parallel can provide twice the memory bandwidth of a single
device. The driver supports the following combinations:

These configuration all require slightly different code to manipulate
the hardware. The AM29xxxxx driver package provides separate functions
for each configuration, for example
<function>cyg_am29xxxxx_erase_16</function> and
<function>cyg_am29xxxxx_program_1616</function>. 
    </para>
    <caution><para>
At the time of writing not all the configurations have been tested.
    </para></caution>
    <para>
The second piece of information is the boot block layout. Flash
devices are subdivided into blocks (also known as sectors - both terms
are in common use). Some operations such as erase work on a whole
block at a time, and for most applications a block is the smallest
unit that gets updated. A typical block size is 64K. It is inefficient
to use an entire 64K block for small bits of configuration data and
similar information, so many flash devices also support a number of
smaller boot blocks. A typical 2MB flash device could have a single
16K block, followed by two 8K blocks, then a 32K block, and finally 31
full-size 64K blocks. The boot blocks may appear at the bottom or the
top of the device. So-called uniform devices do not have boot blocks,
just full-size ones. The driver needs to know the boot block layout.
With modern devices it can work this out at run-time, but often it is
better to provide the information statically.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1 id="am29xxxxx-instance-example"><title>Example</title>
    <para>
In most cases flash support is specific to a platform. Even if two
platforms happen to use the same flash device there are likely to be
differences such as the location in the address map. Hence there is
little possibility of re-using the platform-specific code, and this
code should be placed in the platform HAL rather than in a separate
package. Typically this involves a separate file and a corresponding
compile property in the platform HAL's CDL:
    </para>
    <programlisting width=72>
cdl_package CYGPKG_HAL_M68K_ALAIA {
    &hellip;
    compile -library=libextras.a alaia_flash.c
    &hellip;
}
    </programlisting>
    <para>
The contents of this file will not be accessed directly, only
indirectly via the generic flash API, so normally it would be removed
by link-time garbage collection. To avoid this the object file has to
go into <filename>libextras.a</filename>.
    </para>
    <para>
The actual file <filename>alaia_flash.c</filename> will look something like:
    </para>
    <programlisting>
#include &lt;pkgconf/system.h&gt;

#endif
    </programlisting>
    <para>
The bulk of the file is protected by an <literal>#ifdef</literal> for
the AM29xxxxx flash driver. That driver will only be active if the
generic flash support is enabled. Without that support there will be
no way of accessing the device so instantiating the data structures
would serve no purpose. The rest of the file is split into three
structure definitions. The first supplies the functions which will be
used to perform the actual flash accesses, using a macro provided by
the generic flash code in <filename
class="headerfile">cyg/io/flash_dev.h</filename>. The relevant ones
have an <literal>_16</literal> suffix, indicating that on this board
there is a single 16-bit flash device on a 16-bit bus. The second
provides information specific to AM29xxxxx flash devices.
The third provides the <structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname>
structure needed by the generic flash code, which contains pointers to
the previous two.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1 id="am29xxxxx-instance-functions"><title>Functions</title>
    <para>
All eCos flash device drivers must implement a standard interface,
defined by the generic flash code <varname>CYGPKG_IO_FLASH</varname>.
This interface includes a table of seven function pointers for various
operations: initialization, query, erase, program, read, locking and
unlocking. The query operation is optional and the generic flash
support provides a dummy implementation
<function>cyg_flash_devfn_query_nop</function>. AM29xxxxx flash
devices are always directly accessible so there is no need for a
separate read function. The remaining functions are more complicated.
    </para>
    <para>
Usually the table can be declared <literal>const</literal>. In a ROM
startup application this avoids both ROM and RAM copies of the table,
saving a small amount of memory. <literal>const</literal> should not
be used if the table may be modified by a platform-specific
initialization routine.
    </para>

    <refsect2 id="am29xxxxx-instance-functions-init"><title>Initialization</title>
      <para>
There is a choice of three main initialization functions. The simplest
is <function>cyg_flash_devfn_init_nop</function>, which does nothing.
It can be used if the <structname>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</structname> and
<structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname> structures are fully
initialized statically and the flash will just work without special
effort. This is useful if it is guaranteed that the board will always
be manufactured using the same flash chip, since the nop function
involves the smallest code size and run-time overheads.
      </para>
      <para>
The next step up is
<function>cyg_am29xxxxx_init_check_devid_XX</function>, where
<literal>XX</literal> will be replaced by the suffix appropriate for
the bus configuration. It is still necessary to provide all the device
information statically, including the <structfield>devid</structfield>
field in the <structname>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</structname> structure.
This initialization function will attempt to query the flash device
and check that the provided device id matches the actual hardware. If
there is a mismatch the device will be marked uninitialized and
subsequent attempts to manipulate the flash will fail.
      </para>
      <para>
If the board may end up being manufactured with any of a number of
different flash chips then the driver can perform run-time
initialization, using a <function>cyg_am29xxxxx_init_cfi_XX</function>
function. This queries the flash device as per the Common Flash Memory
Interface Specification, supported by all current devices (although
not necessarily by older devices). The
<structfield>block_info</structfield> field in the
<structname>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</structname> structure and the
<structfield>end</structfield> and
<structfield>num_block_infos</structfield> fields in the
<structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname> structure will be filled in.
It is still necessary to supply the <structfield>start</structfield>
field statically since otherwise the driver will not know how to
access the flash device. The main disadvantage of using CFI is that it
increases the code size.
      </para>
      <caution><para>
If CFI is used then the <structname>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</structname>
structure must not be declared <literal>const</literal>. The CFI code
will attempt to update the structure and will fail if the structure is
held in read-only memory. This would leave the flash driver
non-functional.
      </para></caution>
      <para>
A final option is to use a platform-specific initialization function.
This may be useful if the board may be manufactured with one of a
small number of different flash devices and the platform HAL needs to
adapt to this. The AM29xxxxx driver provides a utility function to
read the device id, <function>cyg_am29xxxxx_read_devid_XX</function>:
      </para>
      <programlisting width=72>
static int
alaia_flash_init(struct cyg_flash_dev* dev)
{
    int devid = cyg_am29xxxxx_read_devid_1616(dev);
    switch(devid) {
        case 0x0042 :
          &hellip;
        case 0x0084 :
          &hellip;
        default:
          return CYG_FLASH_ERR_DRV_WRONG_PART;
    }
}
      </programlisting>
      <para>
There are many other possible uses for a platform-specific
initialization function. For example initial prototype boards might
have only supported 8-bit access to a 16-bit flash device rather than
16-bit access, but this problem was fixed in the next revision. The
platform-specific initialization function can figure out which model
board it is running on and replace the default
<literal>16as8</literal> functions with faster <literal>16</literal>
ones.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2 id="am29xxxxx-instance-functions-erase-program"><title>Erase and Program</title>
      <para>
The AM29xxxxx driver provides erase and program functions appropriate
for the various bus configurations. On most targets these can be used
directly. On some targets it may be necessary to do some extra work
before and after the erase and program operations. For example if the
hardware has an MMU then the part of the address map containing the
flash may have been set to read-only, in an attempt to catch spurious
memory accesses. Erasing or programming the flash requires
write-access, so the MMU settings have to be changed temporarily. As
another example some flash device may require a higher voltage to be
applied during an erase or program operation. or a higher voltage may
be desirable to make the operation proceed faster. A typical
platform-specific erase function would look like this:
      </para>
      <programlisting width=72>
static int
alaia_flash_erase(struct cyg_flash_dev* dev, cyg_flashaddr_t addr)
{
    int result;
    &hellip;  // Set up the hardware for an erase
    result = cyg_am29xxxxx_erase_32(dev, addr);
    &hellip;  // Revert the hardware change
    return result;
}
      </programlisting>
      <para>
There are two configurations which affect the erase and program
functions, and which a platform HAL may wish to change:
<varname>CYGNUM_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX_V2_ERASE_TIMEOUT</varname>
and
<varname>CYGNUM_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX_V2_PROGRAM_TIMEOUT</varname>.
The erase and program operations both involve polling for completion,
and these timeout impose an upper bound on the polling loop. Normally
these operations should never take anywhere close to the timeout
period, so a timeout indicates a catastrophic failure that should
really be handled by a watchdog reset. A reset is particularly
appropriate because there will be no clean way of aborting the flash
operation. The main reason for the timeouts is to help with debugging
when porting to new hardware. If there is a valid reason why a
particular platform needs different timeouts then the platform HAL's
CDL can require appropriate values for these options.
      </para>
    </refsect2>

    <refsect2 id="am29xxxxx-instance-functions-locking"><title>Locking</title>
      <para>
There is no single way of implementing the block lock and unlock
operations on all AM29xxxxx devices. If these operations are supported at
all then usually they involve manipulating the voltages on certain
pins. This would not be able to be handled by generic driver code since it requires
knowing how these pins can be manipulated via the processor's GPIO
lines. Therefore the AM29xxxxx driver does not usually provide lock and unlock
functions, and instead the generic dummy functions
<function>cyg_flash_devfn_lock_nop</function> and
<function>cyg_flash_devfn_unlock_nop</function> should be used. An <link

If real locking functions are implemented then the platform HAL's CDL
script should implement the CDL interface
<varname>CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_BLOCK_LOCKING</varname>. Otherwise the
generic flash package may believe that none of the flash drivers in the
system provide locking functionality and disable the interface functions.

      <title>AT49xxxx locking</title>
      <para>
As locking is standardised across the AT49xxxx family of AMD AM29xxxxx
compatible Flash parts, a method supporting this is included within this
driver. <function>cyg_at49xxxx_softlock_XX</function> provides a means of
locking a Flash sector such that it may be subsequently unlocked.
<function>cyg_at49xxxx_hardlock_XX</function> locks a sector such that
it cannot be unlocked until after reset or a power cycle.
<function>cyg_at49xxxx_unlock_XX</function> unlocks a sector that has
previously been softlocked. At power on or Flash device reset, all sectors
default to being softlocked.

    <refsect2 id="am29xxxxx-instance-functions-other"><title>Other</title>
      <para>
The driver provides a set of functions
<function>cyg_am29xxxxx_read_devid_XX</function>, one per supported
bus configuration. These functions take a single argument, a pointer
to the <structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname> structure, and return
the chip's device id. For older devices this id is a single byte. For
more recent devices the id is a 3-byte value, 0x7E followed by a
further two bytes that actually identify the device.
<function>cyg_am29xxxxx_read_devid_XX</function> is usually called
only from inside a platform-specific driver initialization routine,
allowing the platform HAL to adapt to the actual device present on the
board.

  <refsect1 id="am29xxxxx-instance-devpriv"><title>Device-Specific Structure</title>
    <para>
The <structname>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</structname> structure provides
information specific to AM29xxxxx flash devices, as opposed to the
more generic flash information which goes into the
<structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname> structure. There are only two
fields: <structfield>devid</structfield> and
<structfield>block_info</structfield>.
    </para>
    <para>
<structfield>devid</structfield> is only needed if the driver's
initialization function is set to
<function>cyg_am29xxxxx_init_check_devid_XX</function>. That function
will extract the actual device info from the flash chip and compare it
with the <structfield>devid</structfield> field. If there is a
mismatch then subsequent operations on the device will fail.
    </para>
    <para>
The <structfield>block_info</structfield> field consists of one or
more pairs of the block size in bytes and the number of blocks of that
size. The order must match the actual hardware device since the flash
code will use the table to determine the start and end locations of
each block. The table can be initialized in one of three ways:
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>
If the driver initialization function is set to
<function>cyg_flash_devfn_init_nop</function> or
<function>cyg_am29xxxxx_init_check_devid_XX</function> then the block
information should be provided statically. This is appropriate if the
board will also be manufactured using the same flash chip.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
If <function>cyg_am29xxxxx_init_cfi_XX</function> is used then this
will fill in the block info table. Hence there is no need for static
initialization.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>
If a platform-specific initialization function is used then either
this should fill in the block info table, or the info should be
provided statically.
      </para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>
The size of the <structfield>block_info</structfield> table is
determined by the configuration option
<varname>CYGNUM_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX_V2_ERASE_REGIONS</varname>.
This has a default value of 4, which should suffice for nearly all
AM29xxxxx flash devices. If more entries are needed then the platform
HAL's CDL script should require a larger value.
    </para>
    <para>
If the <structname>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</structname> structure is
statically initialized then it can be <literal>const</literal>. This
saves a small amount of memory in ROM startup applications. If the
structure is updated at run-time, either by
<function>cyg_am29xxxxx_init_cfi_XX</function> or by a
platform-specific initialization routine, then it cannot be
<literal>const</literal>.

  <refsect1 id="am29xxxxx-instance-flash"><title>Flash Structure</title>
    <para>
Internally the generic flash code works in terms of
<structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname> structures, and the platform
HAL should define one of these. The structure should be placed in the
<literal>cyg_flashdev</literal> table. The following fields need to be
provided:
    </para>
    <variablelist>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><structfield>funs</structfield></term>
        <listitem><para>

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><structfield>start</structfield></term>
        <listitem><para>
The base address of the flash in the address map. On
some board the flash may be mapped into memory several times, for
example it may appear in both cached and uncached parts of the address
space. The <structfield>start</structfield> field should correspond to
the cached address.
        </para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><structfield>end</structfield></term>
        <listitem><para>
The address of the last byte in the flash. It can
either be statically initialized, or
<function>cyg_am29xxxxx_init_cfi_XX</function> will calculate
its value at run-time.

      </varlistentry>
      <varlistentry>
        <term><structfield>num_block_infos</structfield></term>
        <listitem><para>
This should be the number of entries in the
<structfield>block_info</structfield> table. It can either be
statically initialized or it will be filled in by
<function>cyg_am29xxxxx_init_cfi_XX</function>.

      <varlistentry>

        <listitem><para>
The table with the block information is held in the
<structname>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</structname> structure, so this field
should just point into that structure.

        <term><structfield>priv</structfield></term>
        <listitem><para>
This field is reserved for use by the device driver. For the AM29xxxxx
driver it should point at the appropriate
<structname>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</structname> structure. 
        </para></listitem>
      </varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
    <para>
The <structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname> structure contains a number
of other fields which are manipulated only by the generic flash code.
Some of these fields will be updated at run-time so the structure
cannot be declared <literal>const</literal>.

  <refsect1 id="am29xxxxx-instance-serial"><title>Multiple Devices</title>
    <para>
A board may have several flash devices in parallel, for example two
16-bit devices on a 32-bit bus. It may also have several such banks
to increase the total amount of flash. If each device provides 2MB,
there could be one bank of 2 parallel flash devices at 0xFF800000 and
another bank at 0xFFC00000, giving a total of 8MB. This setup can be
described in several ways. One approach is to define two
<structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname> structures. The table of
function pointers can usually be shared, as can the
<structname>cyg_am29xxxxx_dev</structname> structure. Another approach
is to define a single <structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname>
structure but with a larger <structfield>block_info</structfield>
table, covering the blocks in both banks of devices. The second
approach makes more efficient use of memory.
    </para>
    <para>
Many variations are possible, for example a small slow flash device
may be used for initial bootstrap and holding the configuration data,
while there is also a much larger and faster device to hold a file
system. Such variations are usually best described by separate
<structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname> structures.
    </para>
    <para>
If more than one <structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname> structure is
instantiated then the platform HAL's CDL script should implement the
CDL interface <varname>CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_DEVICE</varname> once for every
device past the first. Otherwise the generic code may default to the
case of a single flash device and optimize for that.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1 id="am29xxxxx-instance-platform"><title>Platform-Specific Macros</title>
    <para>
The AM29xxxxx driver source code includes the header files
<filename class="headerfile">cyg/hal/hal_arch.h</filename> and
<filename class="headerfile">cyg/hal/hal_io.h</filename>, and hence
indirectly the corresponding platform header files (if defined).
Optionally these headers can define macros which are used inside the
driver, thus giving the HAL limited control over how the driver works.
    </para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1 id="am29xxxxx-instance-cache"><title>Cache Management</title>
    <para>
By default the AM29xxxxx driver assumes that the flash can be accessed
uncached, and it will use the HAL
<function>CYGARC_UNCACHED_ADDRESS</function> macro to map the cached
address in the <structfield>start</structfield> field of the
<structname>cyg_flash_dev</structname> structure into an uncached
address. If for any reason this HAL macro is inappropriate for the
flash then an alternative macro
<function>HAL_AM29XXXXX_UNCACHED_ADDRESS</function> can be defined
instead. However fixing the
<function>CYGARC_UNCACHED_ADDRESS</function> macro is normally the
better solution.
    </para>
    <para>
If there is no way of bypassing the cache then the platform HAL should
implement the CDL interface
<varname>CYGHWR_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX_V2_CACHED_ONLY</varname>. The flash
driver will now disable and re-enable the cache as required. For
example a program operation will involve the following:
    </para>
    <programlisting width=72>
    AM29_INTSCACHE_STATE;
    AM29_INTSCACHE_BEGIN();
    while ( ! finished ) {
        program data
    }
    AM29_INTSCACHE_END();
    </programlisting>
    <para>
The default implementations of these INTSCACHE macros are as follows:
<varname>STATE</varname> defines any local variables that may be
needed, e.g. to save the current interrupt state;
<function>BEGIN</function> disables interrupts, synchronizes the data
caches, disables it, and invalidates the current contents;
<function>END</function> re-enables the cache and then
interrupts. The cache is only disabled when interrupts are disabled,
so there is no possibility of an interrupt handler running or a
context switch occurring while the cache is disabled, potentially
leaving the system running very slowly. The data cache synchronization
ensures that there are no dirty cache lines, so when the cache is
disabled the low-level flash write code will not see stale data in
memory. The invalidate ensures that at the end of the operation
higher-level code will not pick up stale cache contents instead of the
newly written flash data.
    </para>
    <para>
Some implementations of the HAL cache macros may not provide the exact
semantics required by the flash driver. For example
<function>HAL_DCACHE_DISABLE</function> may have an unwanted side
effect, or it may do more work than is needed here. The driver will
check for alternative macros
<function>HAL_AM29XXXXX_INTSCACHE_STATE</function>,
<function>HAL_AM29XXXXX_INTSCACHE_BEGIN</function> and
<function>HAL_AM29XXXXX_INTSCACHE_END</function>, using these instead of
the defaults.
