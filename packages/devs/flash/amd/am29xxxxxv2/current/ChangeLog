2009-04-20  Rene Schipp von Branitz Nielsen <rbn@vitesse.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx.c: Added set of parentheses around macro
	parameters used in multiplications. Fixes 16as8 bug.

2008-12-19  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/flash_am29xxxxx_v2.cdl: Doh, fix doc link properly.

2008-11-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/flash_am29xxxxx_v2.cdl: Fix doc link.

2008-09-24  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c (am29_hw_program): fix handling of parallel
	chips. Get the debug diagnostics to build cleanly.

2008-05-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c (am29_hw_query): Allow devices to return
	device IDs of larger than a byte.

2007-07-08  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx.c, src/am29xxxxx_aux.c: add 2ram entry and exit
	hooks to give HALs some extra control over the low-level flash
	operations.

2007-06-21  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c: issue a memory barrier after every command
	that gets sent to the flash, to avoid problems with pipelines that
	mess about with write ordering.

2007-05-31  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx.c: skip data cache manipulation on architectures
	which do not have a data cache.

2007-05-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/flash_am29xxxxx_v2.cdl
	(CYGHWR_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX_V2_RESET_NEEDS_RESUME): New option.
	Allow Flash devices to indicate that they should be sent a "resume"
	command on startup.
	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c (am29_hw_force_all_suspended_resume): New
	function to implement above CDL.
	(cyg_am29xxxxx_init_check_dev): Call the new function.
	(cyg_am29xxxxx_init_cfi): Ditto.
	(am29_hw_cfi): manufacturer_id and vendor private areas need only
	lowest byte taken, to handle multiple parallel devices.

2007-03-29  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c (am29_hw_erase): use DQ7 to detect
	termination instead of DQ6. This avoids hardware problems where
	the toggling of DQ6 is not detected.

2007-03-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c (am29_hw_cfi): Added missing AM29_SWAP() to
	fetch of offset of vendor specific data.

2006-09-27  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c (am29_hw_cfi): Added generic code to deal
	with flash parts that may specify their erase regions in reverse
	order to reality. Removed older code that was too specific to
	particular devices.
	A few changes to the diagnostics in various places.

	* cdl/flash_am29xxxxx_v2.cdl: Replaced
	CYGHWR_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX_V2_AT49_CFI with
	CYGHWR_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX_V2_CFI_BOGOSITY. This option
	performs much the same purpose, but is generic to many more flash
	parts.

2006-08-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c: Added support for ST flash parts which have
	similar, but not identical, peculiarities in their CFI data to the
	Atmel parts supported earlier.

2006-08-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx.c: Provide a default HAL_MEMORY_BARRIER()
	define if the HAL hasn't provided one.
	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c: Use HAL_MEMORY_BARRIER() any time the
	flash is reset back to read array mode. Some processors
	need to have their write buffers flushed.

2006-06-29  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/flash_am29xxxxx_v2.cdl:
	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c:
	Added configurable delay between each word during
	programming. Some targets seem to need this.
	Also added some simple diagnostics.

2006-05-15  John Dallaway  <jld@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/am29xxxxx.sgml: Fix missing </refentry> tag.
	* cdl/flash_am29xxxx_v2.cdl: Reference package documentation.

2005-09-26  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx.c, src/am29xxxxx_aux.c: add AM29_SWAP() support for
	platforms where the bus connection is wired up strangely.

	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c, cdl/flash_am29xxxxx_v2.cdl: add optional
	support for certain Atmel chips which have a peculiar
	implementation of CFI.

2005-08-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/flash_am29xxxx_v2.cdl: Provide new
	CYGIMP_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX_V2_LEAVE_INTERRUPTS_ENABLED
	and CYGHWR_DEVS_FLASH_AMD_AM29XXXXX_V2_CACHED_ONLY options
	to provide better control of when to enable/disable interrupts
	or caches. Taken from the Strata flash example.
	* include/am29xxxxx_dev.h: Declare cyg_at49xxxx_softlock, _hardlock
	and _unlock variants.
	* src/am29xxxxx.c: Define AT49 locking commands.
	Provide AM29_UNCACHE_ADDRESS in line with the Strata driver,
	to be controlled by the above new CDL options, in place of
	AM29_P2V.
	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c: Provide AT49 lock status definition.
	Provide AT49 softlock/hardlock/unlock API functions and
	underlying implementation functions.
	Adopt AM29_UNCACHED_ADDRESS rename.
	* doc/am29xxxxx.sgml: Update documentation to cover AT49xxxx
	locking operations and above new CDL options.
	
2005-06-12  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c (cyg_am29xxxxx_program): remove unnecessary
	loops variable
	* cdl/flash_am29xxxxx_v2.cdl: minor reorganization to put the
	important config option first
	* doc/am29xxxxx.sgml: document the important config options

2005-02-23  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/am29xxxxx.sgml: bring up to date.

2005-01-19  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx_aux.c (am29_hw_erase): Handle interleaved
	(parallel) flash correctly when one device finishes before another.
	(am29_hw_program): Similar.
	(cyg_am29xxxxx_program): Use assert correctly.
	
	* src/am29xxxxx.c (AM29_NEXT_DATUM_32): Use cyg_uint32, not
	cyg_uint16.
	
2004-12-02  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/am29xxxxx.c, include/am29xxxxx_dev.h: <cyg/io/flash_priv.h>
	no longer exists, use <cyg/io/flash_dev.h> instead.

2004-11-29  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* include/am29xxxxx_dev.h, src/am29xxxxx.c: eliminate
	hwr_map_error() support, no longer needed
	
	* include/am29xxxxx_dev.h, src/am29xxxxx.c, src/am29xxxxx_aux.c:
	The dummy init/query/lock/unlock functions have been moved to the
	generic flash package. That also now exports an anonymizer
	function.

2004-11-25  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/flash_am29xxxxx_v2.cdl, src/am29xxxxx.c,
	src/am29xxxxx_aux.c: this driver can manage the flash and
	interrupts itself, without support from the generic flash code.

2004-11-22  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* include/am29xxxxx_dev.h, src/am29xxxxx.c, src/am29xxxxx_aux.c,
	doc/am29xxxxx.sgml: implement changes to the interface between the
	generic flash code and the device drivers.
	* include/am29xxxxx_dev.h: rename cyg_block_info to
	cyg_flash_block_info

2004-11-21  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* doc/am29xxxxx.sgml: describe CDL implications for custom locking
	functions and additional devices.
	
	* cdl/flash_am29xxxxx_v2.cdl: CYGHWR_IO_FLASH_DEVICE_V2 is now
	implicit

2004-11-05  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* New AM29xxxxx flash driver created
