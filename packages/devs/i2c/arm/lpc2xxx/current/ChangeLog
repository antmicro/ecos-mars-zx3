	* src/i2c_lpc2xxx.c: Implemented support for multiple I2C busses
	  Call DSR only if there is something to signal. Removed
	  declaration of I2C bus via CYG_I2C_BUS() macro - this belongs in
	  the platform HAL.
	
	* include/i2c_lpc2xxx.h: New file with macro definition of macro
	  CYG_LPC2XXX_I2C_BUS() for I2C bus declaration by platform HAL
	  
	* cdl/i2c_lpc2xxx.cdl: Added CYGHWR_DEVS_I2C_ARM_LPC2XXX_MULTIPLE_BUSES
