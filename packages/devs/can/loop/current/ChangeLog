	* tests/can_overrun1.c (can0_thread): Fix the length of the data
	  in the message. Add a delay to allow the CAN device to process
	  the packets.
	* test/can_txcevent.c: (can0_thread): Add a delay to allow the CAN device
	 to process the packet.s
	* src/loop_can.c (FIFO_SIZE): Changed to one more than the TX
	  queue size. If it is less, the loopback tests don't pass because
	  packets don't get transmitted.

	* doc/synth_test.ecm: Import file for running the tests on synth.

	* tests/can_callback.c: Added test of CAN callback on event
	* cdl/can_loop.cdl: Added can_callback.c into tests list
	
2007-08-09  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/loop_can.c: Change all CYGPKG_IO_CAN_* to CYGPKG_DEVS_CAN_*
	  so that the loopback driver gets compiled. It looks like
	  at some point in its life it used to live in io/can instead
	  of its current location in dev/can/loop.

2007-03-23  Uwe Kindler  <uwe_kindler@web.de>

    * cdl/can_loop.cd: Changed naming of various options from 
      xxx_IO_CAN_LOOP into xxx_DEVS_CAN_LOOP

2007-03-23  Uwe Kindler  <uwe_kindler@web.de>

	* cdl/can_loop.cdl: Driver now implements the interfaces
	  CYGINT_IO_CAN_TX_EVENTS, CYGINT_IO_CAN_STD_CAN_ID, 
	  CYGINT_IO_CAN_EXT_CAN_ID.
	  Removed CYGPKG_IO_CAN_LOOP_CFLAGS_ADD and 
	  CYGPKG_IO_CAN_LOOP_CFLAGS_REMOVE because they had no function.
	  
	* src/loop_can.c: Added missing function loop_can_get_config
	  to make the driver build properly.
	
	* tests: Did some fixes and cleanups for all test cases to make them
	  work properly with the changes in the CAN I/O layer.

	* Loopback CAN driver created
