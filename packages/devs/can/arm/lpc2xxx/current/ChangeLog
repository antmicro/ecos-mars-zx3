	* Changes made to support CAN IO package update:
	* cdl/can_lpc2xxx.cdl: CYGOPT_DEVS_CAN_LPC2XXX_EXTENDED_CFG_KEYS
	replaced by CYG_IO_SET_CONFIG_CAN_RANGE_FILTER.
	* include/can_lpc2xxx.h: Commented out unused and not implemented
	things.
	* src/can_lpc2xxx.c: CYGNUM_CAN_EVENT_OVERRUN_RX_HW instead of
	CYGNUM_CAN_EVENT_OVERRUN_RX. CYGOPT_DEVS_CAN_LPC2XXX_EXTENDED_CFG_KEYS
	replaced by CYG_IO_SET_CONFIG_CAN_RANGE_FILTER. can_lpc2xxx.h not
	required any more. CYGNUM_CAN_MODE_LISTEN_ONLY_ENTER &
	CYGNUM_CAN_MODE_LISTEN_ONLY_EXIT return -EINVAL.
	[ Bugzilla 1001453 ]

	* cdl/can_lpc2xxx.cdl: Added CYGOPT_DEVS_CAN_LPC2XXX_ALIE to make 
	arbitration lost interrupt optional. Added option
	CYGNUM_DEVS_CAN_LPC2XXX_INT_PRIORITY to configure the interrupt
	priority for global CAN interrupt in LPC24xx variants.
	
	* include/can_lpc2xxx_baudrates.h: Replaced CYGNUM_CAN_LPC2XXX_VPB_CLK
	by CYGNUM_HAL_ARM_LPC2XXX_CAN_CLK because newer variants like LPC24xx
	do not have a global VPB_CLK.
	
	* src/can_accfilt_lpc2xxx.c: Adjusted LPC2XXX_CAN_FIRST_IN_LUT to
	be 0 for LPC24xxx variants. Added macro CAN_CHAN_NO_LUT(_info_) to
	abstract channel numbering from acceptance filter code.
	
	* src/can_lpc2xxx.c: Removed icr data field from lpc2xxx_can_info_st
	structure because it is not required any longer. A lot of small
	modifications to make the driver usable with newer LPC2xxx variants like
	LPC24xx. ISR and DSR code changed - instead of disabling interrupts in 
	IER register they are disabled in VIC by using cyg_drv_interrupt_mask()
	function calls. Added global CAN ISR and DSR for LPC24xx variants 
	(they do not support individual interrupt vectors for RX and TX
	interrupts). Moved LUT error checking code from ISR into DSR to keep
	ISR as short as possible and made LUT error checking code optional.

	* cdl/can_lpc2xxx.cdl: add CAN interrupt priorities
	
	* src/can_lpc2xxx.c: add CAN interrupt priorities, 
	  repair "chan" definition missing in rx_ISR
	
	* src/can_accfilt_lpc2xxx.c: add various types of CAN controllers
	  numbering (depends on LPC2XXX version)
	
2007-08-17 Hans Rosenfeld <rosenfeld@grumpf.hope-2000.org>
	
	* src/can_lpc2xxx.c: The definition of "info" is missing when only
	  one CAN channel is configured.
	
2007-08-17  Uwe Kindler <uwe_kindler@web.de>
	
	* include/can_lpc2xxx_baudrates.h: Removed all prefixed zeros from
	  baudrate table entries (they aren't intended to be interpreted as 
	  octal)
	  
	* tests/can_baudrates.c
	  tests/can_busload.c
	  tests/can_rx_tx.c: removed #include pkgconf/devs_can_loop.h
	
2007-08-02  Alexey Shusharin <mrfinch@mail.ru>
	
	* src/can_lpc2xxx.c: Added acknowledging call in rx interrupt
	  (self-reception part)
	
2007-07-07  Alexey Shusharin <mrfinch@mail.ru>

	* cdl/can_lpx2xxx.cdl: Option
	  CYGOPT_DEVS_CAN_LPC2XXX_USE_SELF_RECEPTION added for enabling
	  self reception requests instead of transmission requests.
	
	* src/can_lpc2xxx.c: Some small bugs fixed. Added support for LUT
	  error. Support for self transmission request added. Debug output
	  improved.
	  
	* src/can_accfilt_lpc2xxx.c: Added support for baudrates of 10kbaud 
	  and 20 kbaud at clock speed of 60 MHz
	
2007-07-01  Uwe Kindler  <uwe_kindler@web.de>

	* include/can_lpc2xxx.h
	* include/can_lpc2xxx_baudrates.h
	* src/can_lpc2xxx.c
	* src/can_accfilt_lpc2xxx.c
