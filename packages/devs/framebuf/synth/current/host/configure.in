dnl The current version of the synthetic target is implemented only for
dnl x86 Linux platforms, so a test is appropriate here. However
dnl it is not a good idea for the configure script to report an error:
dnl that would prevent any top-level configury working for other
dnl platforms. Instead an automake conditional is used to suppress adding
dnl targets to the build. Unfortunately it is still necessary to
dnl perform most of the tests or you run into problems with e.g.
dnl automake's dependency handling.
