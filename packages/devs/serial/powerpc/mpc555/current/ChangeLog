	* cdl/ser_powerpc_mpc555.cdl: Add HW queue option
        * src/mpc555_serial_with_ints.c:
        To help resolve an issue of characters being lost a software buffer
        has been added between the Rx ISR and DSR when no hardware queue is 
        being used.
        A cdl option to enable support the hardware queue on the first serial 
        port has been added. This enables 16 character hardware Tx and Rx 
        buffers to be used which allows continuous transmission and reception
        of serial data and significantly improves performance.
