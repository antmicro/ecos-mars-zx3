	* src/usbs_at91.c   : Complete support for halting endpoints
	* cdl/usbs_at91.cdl : Add option 
	CYGSEM_DEVS_USB_AT91_ZERO_LENGTH_PACKET_TERMINATION. When data
	transfer length is known from both side, sending an empty packet
	at the end of the transfer is not required.
	Add devtab entry for endpoints 4 to 7.

	* src/usbs_at91.c (usbs_at91_set_pullup): Fix typo introduced by
          Andrew Lunn in the last patch.

2008-11-03  Gabor Toeroek <tgabor84@gmail.com>

	* cdl/usbs_at91.cdl: 
	* include/usbs_at91.h:
	* src/usbs_at91.c:
	* src/usbs_at91_data.c: Support for SAM7SE which has an internal
	  pullup.  Added extra endpoints for those chips that have them.
	
2007-11-20  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/usbs_at91.cdl: Fixed typos in
	CYGNUM_DEVS_USB_AT91_GPIO_PULLUP_INVERTED and
	CYGNUM_DEVS_USB_AT91_GPIO_READ_POWER_INVERTED. Fixing the typo.

	* src/usbs_at91.c (usbs_at91_set_pullup): Change the logic so that
	CYGNUM_DEVS_USB_AT91_GPIO_PULLUP_INVERTED does actually cause an
	invert when set true.

	* cdl/usbs_at91.c: Read actual EP addresses from the EP configuartion
	rather than relying on the order in the configuration list.

2006-06-06  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/usbs_at91.cdl: Allow EP0 to be enabled when there are no
	slave clients.

2006-05-25  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/usbs_at91_data.cxx: Change the initialization priority.  The
	USB tty driver is initialized at priority CYG_INIT_IO, so the USB
	device has to be initialized before that.

2006-05-19  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/usbs_at91.c: Rework pullup and power dectect to use the AT91
	GPIO macros.

2006-05-07  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* Included into eCos anonymous CVS.

	Note: There appears to be a hardware bug with OUT transfers.  It
	appears that after resetting the endpoint, the first OUT transfer
	does not trigger a receive interrupt. The BK0 bit is not set,
	however the number of bytes in the receiver FIFO is correct.  The
	second OUT transfer causes both BK0 and BK1 bits to be set and an
	interrupt generated. Currently no workaround is used to correct
	this behavoiour. 
 	
2006-04-23  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/usbs_at91.c: Endpoint 3 can send upto 64 bytes at a time,
	not 8.

2006-04-20  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/usbs_at91.c (usbs_at91_control_data_sent): Send a zero byte
	packet when the transfer is an exact multiple of the endpoint
	buffer size.
	
2006-04-16  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/usbs_at91.c (usbs_testing_endpoints): Added support for the
	USB testcase framework by exporting what endpoint we have.
	* src/usbs_at91.c (usbs_at91_control_setup): Make requests other
	than standard requests work, eg CLASS, VENDOR etc.
	* src/usbs_at91.c (usbs_at91_handle_reset): Configure the endpoint 
	hardware using the configuration information.
	* src/usbs_at91.c (usbs_at91_control_data_sent): Transaction is
	complete when the buffer is empty _and_ there is no refill
	function defined.
	
2006-03-10  Oliver Munz  <oli@snr.ch>

	* CDL-Update for PLL-Freuenzy.

2006-03-06  Oliver Munz  <oli@snr.ch>

	* USB device driver work finished - haha.
	
	What's missing:
	The set_... and get_freature-host-commands are not implemented yet.
	The dynamical configuration of the data-endpoints is not reflectet in
	the "usbs.h" API.
	Isochronus transfer is not implemented.
	Polling routines are not implemented.
	USB-Tests are not done.
	The PowerDetectPin is not used for the state.
	AT91SAM7X's are not supported at the moment.
	
	But it works for me...
