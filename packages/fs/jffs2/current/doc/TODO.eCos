 - Make symlinks work properly.

 - Fill in the skeleton gcthread.c so it actually does something.

 - Check and possibly fix locking of icache mangling in fs-ecos.c

 - Check that os-ecos.h defines 'spin_lock()' to something appropriate.

 - Fix unmount of root file system after chdir().

 - Fix atomicity of renames. Why was the unlink added before rename?

 - Further cleanup -- should the functions in dir-ecos.c take 'struct
   dirsearch' instead of various components thereof, or should each of
   those functions just be moved inside its only caller in fs-ecos.c?

 - Improve mount time by using pointer directly into flash chip instead
   of jffs2_flash_read() for the initial scan -- look at the #ifdef
   __ECOS bit in scan.c for details.

 - Reduce memory usage. There are fields marked for possible removal in
   struct _inode, and there's the __totlen field in struct
   jffs2_raw_node_ref as discussed recently.
