2005-03-27  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	complaining.

2004-05-31  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>
		
	* src/vnc-server.c:
	lwIP has network.h too so get rid of ifdefs.

2004-02-17  Chris Garry  <cgarry@sweeneydesign.co.uk>
	* src/vnc-server.c:
	Remove prototypes for lwIP functions - now contained in lwIP
	header files.

	* src/vnc-server.c:

	* cdl/vnc-server.cdl: Add support for BGR233 (8 bit) mode, since
	newer viewers support this on all displays.

2003-08-31  Chris Garry  <cgarry@sweeneydesign.co.uk>

	* src/vnc-server.c:
	Always send colour data to client in big endian format.
	When doing frame updates, do not call send command until there
	if 1460 bytes of data unless the data is all that is left for the
	cuurent frame update (huge improvement with lwIP stack).
	Fixed bug where VncPrintf() did not handle characters not defined
	for the selected font.
	VncPrintf() does not mark tiles for update when do_print argument
	is not set.
	
	* tests/vnc-test.c:
	Modifed the test to use select() function.  Added more examples
	of using the VNC server API.
