	* src/jim-aio.c (JimAioHandlerCommand): GCC 4.3.1 pointed out a
	buffer overrun.

2008-06-17 Anthony Tonizzo <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	Jumbo patch containing many individual patches from a number of
	different contributors on different days. The ChangeLog entries
	for all these individual patches are:
	
        2007-12-02  Anthony Tonizzo <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* src/socket.c src/httpd.c: Corrected a bug in
	cyg_httpd_write_chunked(): Now the CRLF that terminates a chunk is
	added by the function and not expected to be there already in the
	data supplied by the user. Modified the function
	cyg_httpd_end_chunked() so that the flag
	CYG_HTTPD_MODE_TRANSFER_CHUNKED is always cleared after it
	terminates. The cyg_httpd_process_request() now loops as many
	times as the number of full requests received.  Renamed header_end
	to request_end to better reflect its real use, and the fact that
	the former name was misleading for POST requests (Danny
	Sade). Changed the function that collects a request: Now the
	remaining part of an incomplete request is copied back to the
	beginning of the buffer. This avoids that multiple split headers
	might creep towards the end of the buffer.

        2007-11-28  Rene' Nielsen <rbn@vitesse.com> and 
	            Anthony Tonizzo <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* doc/athttpd.sgml: Included Digest (MD5) authentication as fully
	supported.
	* cdl/httpd.cdl: Updated the cdl to reflect the fact that MD5
	authentication is now a fully tested feature, at least on some
	clients (Thanks to Tad for testing this!)
	* src/httpd.c: Added the initialization of the global variable
	cyg_httpd_md5_response. This corrects a security hole that could
	allow unauthenticated browsers to access pages that require
	authentication. This required a minor change (switch of variables
	used) in the authentication code. Added code to avoid a buffer
	overflow during the parsing of headers for authenticated
	pages. Clear the CYG_HTTPD_MODE_SEND_HEADER_ONLY at the beginning
	of any request.
	* src/auth.c: Removed dead code and made static a bunch of
	functions and variables.
	* src/auth.h: The AUTH_STORAGE_BUFFER_LENGTH value is now split
	into two numbers, one that gives the maximum length of the login
	phrase and one for the password.
	* src/socket.c: Added a NULL terminator after each header packet
	that is received. Now the strstr() is guaranteed to find
	terminated string.

        2007-11-27  Tad Artis <ecos@ds3switch.com>

	* src/auth.c: Modified the cyg_httpd_digest_data() and
	cyg_httpd_digest_skip() functions to support IE7. A careful read
	of the augmented BNF in RFC2616 indicates that spaces within the
	elements of the authentication header are optional. The original
	atHTTPD code incorrectly relied on a space after the comma. Moved
	the authentication check inside cyg_httpd_process_method() so that
	each request, regardless of the type, will have to go through
	authentication.

        2007-11-26  Tad Artis <ecos@ds3switch.com> and 
	            Anthony Tonizzo <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* src/forms.c: Checked for a null terminator inside
	cyg_httpd_store_form_variable, so that we do not scan past the end
	of the packet. Check the form variables for both length and
	content, to avoid false positives. Modified cyg_httpd_from_hex()
	to return -1 in case of error.
	* src/httpd.c: Corrected the strings sent back by the server to
	challenge the client to an MD5 authentication. Adds a couple of
	commas to separate the items in the string.
	* src/http.h:
	* src/socket.h: Corrected a number of indexes where
	CYGNUM_FILEIO_NFILE was used instead of the correct
	CYGPKG_NET_MAXSOCKETS.

2008-03-04  Danny Sade  <danny@channelot.com>

	* src/socket.c: put NULL at the end of inbuff on each iteration,
	preventing strstr from looking at old data beyond inbuffer_len

2007-11-12  Oyvind Harboe  <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>
2007-11-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* doc/athttpd.sgml: added an example of a tcl script.
	* src/http.c, forms.c: serve cgi requests before file system requests,
	that way it isn't possible to download the actual cgi/.o script and
	cgi works even if the http root directory is above the cgi directory.
	* src/http.c: if only tcl cgi is enabled, cgi requests are now
	forwarded to tcl
	* include/jim.h: include file order fix; now compiles again.
	* doc/athttpd.sgml: Fixed typos in doc. Return value from handler is
	not used, recommend returning 0 in doc.

2006-12-03  Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: Corrected a CDL error in the requirements of
	CYGOPT_NET_ATHTTPD_USE_FS

2006-11-27  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: Improve CDL dependencies.

2006-11-08  Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* doc/athttpd.sgml: Updated to describe lasted changes and corrected
	minor typos.
	* src/http.c: Check for "Content-Type" header. This is needed if we
	want to support parsing form variables in POST requests.
	* src/jim.c: Updated with latest release from Jim CVS.
	* src/cgi.c: streamlined cyg_httpd_exec_cgi_tcl(), now uses the 'source'
	command of tcl to execute a tcl script.
	* src/forms.c: Modified cyg_handle_method_POST so that the variables in the
	payload are scanned only if the request has a Content-Type 
	of 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
	* src/jim-aio.c: Added to package. Now tcl has IO functions to access a
	file system.
	* include/httpd.h: Added a new mode, CYG_HTTPD_MODE_FORM_DATA which is set
	when a POST request has a Content-Type of 
	'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
	    
2006-10-16  Lars Povlsen  <lpovlsen@vitesse.com> and Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: add CYGOPT_NET_ATHTTPD_CLOSE_CHUNKED_CONNECTIONS. Default
	is set to CLOSE, so it is backward compatible with 
	previous versions of the browser.
	* src/socket.c: cyg_httpd_process_request() uses a loop to collect at least
	one full frame (til a header terminator is found), 
	cyg_httpd_start_chunked() only close if configured to do so.
	* src/httpd.c: Overhaul of cyg_httpd_send_error to avoid the use of
	inbuffer as temporary storage (conflicts with pipelined frames),
	removed the option to send a page after calling a C language
	handler
	* include/httpd.h: Added a new mode, CYG_HTTPD_MODE_NO_CACHE
	    
2006-10-12  Lars Povlsen  <lpovlsen@vitesse.com> and Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: add CYGNUM_ATHTTPD_SERVER_MAX_POST to limit POST'ed data
	* include/http.h: Added header_end, post_data fields to httpstate,
	Added "302 Found" for POST handler redirect (CYG_HTTPD_STATUS_MOVED_TEMPORARILY)
	* src/forms.c: Fixed variable decoding, fixed large POST processing
	* src/http.c: Fixed some debug ouptuts, cleanup after POST processing, 
	overhaul of the pipelined requests code which can now
	handle multiple requests per frame.
	* src/socket.c: Removed assert for socket write failure, Accumulating receiving
	of requests (Browsers (Firefox) may pass partial headers in separate 
	fragments). Fixed some diagnostics output.

2006-07-19  Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com> and Sergei Gavrikov  <w3sg@softhome.net>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: 
	* doc/athttpd.sgml: Corrected some typos and rectified some omissions.
	* include/jim.h:    Added an inline to Jim_InitExtension()
	* src/cgi.c:        used malloc() instead of cyg_ldr_malloc();
	* src/forms.c:      Added a #define to be able tio use the TCL scripting
	without OBJLOADER
	* src/http.c:       
	* src/socket.c:     Lots of typos stamped out, and some better comments too.
	                     
2006-07-19  Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* src/socket.c: Corrected a typo that generated an assertion.
	Modified slightly the source of cyg_httpd_write and cyg_httpd_writev
	to make the code more consistent as to when assertions are thrown.

2006-07-19  Sergei Gavrikov  <w3sg@softhome.net>

	* doc/athttpd.sgml: jade doesn't allow underscores in
	id attributes, so fix.

2006-07-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/httpd.cdl: Add -D __ECOS in compiler flags.
	Change include_dir to cyg/athttpd.
	Rename all CDL options from *_HTTPD_* to *_ATHTTPD_*.
	* All files: Rename cyg/httpd include directory to cyg/athttpd.
	Rename all CDL options from *_HTTPD_* to *_ATHTTPD_*.
	* doc/athttpd.sgml: Document MD5 algorithm licensing.
	* src/socket.c: Remove unused SNTP include.
