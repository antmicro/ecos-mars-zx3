2007-09-15  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* tests/strptime.c (test): Extend the test so that it triggers the
	previous bug and shows that the fix works.

2007-08-18  Hans Rosenfeld  <rosenfeld@grumpf.hope-2000.org>

	* src/strftime.cxx: Moved CYG_PRECONDITIONs to do_format() to
	make strftime() only complain about illegal struct tm contents if
	these are actually used. Fixes a bug with tests/strptime which
	would fail because tm->tm_yday was uninitialized.
	
2006-10-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/strftime.c (test): Fix %I test.

2006-08-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/time.cdl: Don't bother inlining mktime() or
	gmtime_r() by default - they're too big to be worth it.

2006-08-24  Alexander Neundorf <alexander.neundorf@jenoptik.com>

	* src/strftime.cxx: Fixed "%I" (Time in 12 hour modus was 1 hour off)

2006-06-16  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* tests/strptime.c: Add a testcase for the previous fix.

2006-06-13  Dan Jakubiec  <dan.jakubiec@systech.com>

	* src/strptime.cxx: Removed the initialization of the struct tm fields
	to prevent clobbering of time values when using the following format
	specifiers: %D, %r, %R, %T, %X, %x.

2005-03-27  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/time.h: Added CYGBLD_ATTRIB_STRFTIME_FORMAT where
	appropriate so the compiler does more checking.

2004-08-08  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/strptime.cxx: fix spelling

2003-08-18  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/strptime.cxx: Added string.h to fix compile warnings.  
	* cdl/time.cdl: Updated the requires statement for BSD string
	functions to use the interface rather than the option name.
	
2003-06-26  Brij Bihari Pandey  <fuzzhead012@yahoo.com>
2003-06-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/clock.c (main): Add a fudge factor in case the absolute values
	from clock() are small, in which case the percentage variation
	would be large.

2003-06-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* tests/clock.c (main): Avoid div-by-zero if mean==0.

	* cdl/time.cdl: build all POSIX files all the time because they
	are used internally by the standard ISO C functions even if not
	exported.
	[Bug 1000001]

2003-04-24  Robert Cragie  <rcc@jennic.com>

	* include/time.inl:
	* include/timeutil.h:
	* src/timeutil.cxx:
	Change return type of cyg_libc_time_itoa() to cyg_ucount8.
	* src/strftime.cxx:
	Change return type of do_format() to cyg_count8.
	These benign changes get around a compiler bug using or32-elf-gcc

2003-03-18  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/strptime.cxx: Initialize time structure to a well known, valid,
	time/date so even if there is an error, it still makes [some] sense.

2003-02-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/time.cdl: Fix doc link.

2003-01-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/time.cdl: Correct reference to
	CYGSEM_LIBC_TIME_POSIX_TIME_ROUTINES in CYGPKG_LIBC_TIME_TESTS to
	CYGFUN_LIBC_TIME_POSIX.

2003-01-27  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* tests/strptime.c: 
	* src/strptime.cxx: 
	* include/time.h: 
	* cdl/time.cdl: Add support for strptime().

2002-05-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/time.cdl: Added -Wno-format to the compiler flags. This is
	to avoid warnings about Y2K problems with the format specifiers
	used in the strftime test.

2002-01-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@redhat.com>

	* tests/clock.c (cyg_start): Added CYG_TEST_INIT() to
	NOTAPPLICABLE version of cyg_start() so that the breakpoints are
	correctly sequenced in the testfarm and it does not think that
	this is a failure.

2001-06-22  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/time.cdl (CYGFUN_LIBC_TIME_SUS_EXTNS): Added.
	* src/strftime.cxx (do_format): Added some Single UNIX
	extensions.

2001-04-25  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* tests/time.c (MAX_TIMEOUT):
	Increase timeout to cope with fast architectures such as the
	synthetic target.

2001-04-17  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* tests/clock.c:
	Cope with synthetic target reorg

2000-11-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/clock.c: Some targets are quite inconsistent, so skip
	6 samples now, and increase the tolerance to 40%.
	Also NA if tracing enabled.
	Also output the mean and maximum error reached, even when passing.

2000-11-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/clock.c: Skip fourth sample too.

2000-11-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/clock.c: Skip first three samples.

2000-10-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/time.inl: Ensure POSIX *_r functions can be accessed by
	non-POSIX implementation even when CYGFUN_LIBC_TIME_POSIX is off.

	* src/asctime_r.cxx: No need to make conditional on posix CDL option - 
	we may want to define an internal-only function.
	* src/ctime_r.cxx: Ditto
	* src/gmtime_r.cxx: Ditto
	* src/localtime_r.cxx: Ditto

	* cdl/time.cdl: abs() is also a requirement

	* src/clock.cxx (clock): Always use unsigned long longs for temp
	variables (and make sure it's used), rather than making
	assumptions about clock_t.

	* tests/clock.c: Rewrite

2000-07-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/time.cdl: Add CYGINT_ISO_DIV dependency

2000-07-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* src/time.cxx: 
	* src/settime.cxx: 
	Wallclock moved to io/

2000-06-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/time.inl (__gmtime_r): Don't save leap year status when
	calculating tm_wday

2000-06-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/time.inl (gmtime_r): Deal with boundary case correctly

	* tests/gmtime.c (test): Add a couple more test cases

2000-05-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/time.h: Just use the defaults for time_t, clock_t and
	CLOCKS_PER_SEC in isoinfra

	* New package
	Separated original libc out into separate packages on functional
	boundaries.
	Header files are now managed by isoinfra package
	Plenty of cleanups done, but no major functionality changes
