        * include/ppc8xx.h: Add definition for frame and parity errors in BD ctrl.
        Changed macro calculating SMCMR CLEN.
        
2004-04-01  Robert Chenault  <robertchenault@yahoo.com>

	* include/ppc8xx.h: Add definition for 8 bytes to spi_pram structure
	(for a total of 48 bytes) as is done in the i2c_pram structure. Then
	remove the equivalent 8 reserved bytes in the scc_pram structure.

2003-09-08  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Fix baud rate clock setup - was off by 1.
	Reported by Tord Andersson <Tord.Andersson@combitechsystems.com>

2003-03-31  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_hal_sccx_init_channel): Proper handling
	(signal routing) for SCC3 - differs on 850 and 850T!

2003-03-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_hal_smcx_init_channel): 
	(cyg_hal_sccx_init_channel): 

	* src/cpm.c: Include <string.h> for memset().
	(_mpc8xx_reset_cpm): use CPM busy flag to check reset completion.
	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Include <string.h> for memset().
	(cyg_hal_smcx_init_channel): Don't reset CPM here - let variant
	initialization do it. Only let through RX interrupts.
	(cyg_hal_sccx_init_channel): Ditto.

2003-03-23  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Use new baud rate generator allocation functions.
	Merge SMC and SCC output functions.
	
	* src/cpm.c: Add new function to allocate and manage the baud rate
	generators.  Used by all serial drivers.

	* include/ppc8xx.h: Some common definitions moved here from various
	QUICC serial files.

	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Add interface for SCC4 (not implemented
	by any platform yet)

2003-03-20  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/cpm.c (_mpc8xx_allocBd): Improve "best guess" for intial DPRAM
	allocation to use a value which is likely not to conflict with old 
	versions of RedBoot.

2003-03-18  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_hal_sccx_init_channel): Update initialization
	for SCC2 - *CAUTION* not tested on actual hardware.

2003-03-06  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/cpm.c: Handle case where DPRAM allocation is unknown.
	
	* include/ppc8xx.h: Define limits of CPM/DPRAM space.

2003-03-05  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Need to flush data cache because the serial
	driver may set use buffers in cacheable memory.  Without this,
	diag_printf() falls over if the serial driver is ever used.

	* src/cpm.c: New file with CPM/DPRAM support.

	* include/ppc8xx.h: 
	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Split out support for CPM/DPRAM.

2002-11-26  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Initialize BD allocation point.  Note that it is
	different from when the CPM get's reset directly.  This is to allow
	sharing of the space between ROM (RedBoot) code and applications.

	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Move platform define here, where it belongs.

2002-11-25  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@ecoscentric.com>

2002-07-18  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_hal_scc1_init_channel): Fix init which
	failed from power-up - wrong channel in CP command!

2002-07-11  Gary Thomas  <gary@chez-thomas.org>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: 
	* include/quicc_smc1.h: 
	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Add support for SCC1 as a serial
	console (for newer chips which have this available).

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: 
	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Use more common CDL name for baudrate
	CYGNUM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_CONSOLE_CHANNEL_BAUD.

2002-05-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Fix warning.

2001-09-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl (CYGNUM_HAL_QUICC_DIAG_BAUD):
	234000->230400 typo.

2001-07-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>
2001-07-31  Christoph Csebits  <christoph.csebits@frequentis.com>

	* include/ppc8xx.h: 4 SCCs are supported by MPC860T, so don't
	reserve space.

2001-01-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Removed CYGSEM_HAL_VIRTUAL_VECTOR_DIAG check. 

2001-01-15  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Provide for multiple serial input buffers
	since the single buffer/descriptor model fails miserably on some
	newer chips [at least 855T].

2001-01-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* include/ppc8xx.h: Layout of I2C and IDMA was [slightly] wrong.

2000-08-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_hal_plf_serial_init_channel): Move all
	init code to init_channel.

2000-06-30  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: calling i/f macro changes.

2000-06-28  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/quicc_smc1.h: 
	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Cleanup.

2000-06-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/quicc_smc1.h:
	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Added non-block/timout features. Reworked
	Ctrl-c support code.

	procs table.

2000-06-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (hal_ctrlc_isr): Check that interrupt is
	generated by serial controller.

2000-06-13  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c:
	* include/quicc_smc1.h:
	Added ctrlc handling for use via virtual vector table.

2000-03-03  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Use common CPM defines (now in ppc8xx.h).

	* include/ppc8xx.h: Add some generic defines for CPM.  Also
	refine ucode area for easier use (someday).

start-serialize-newcdl
2000-02-29  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (UART_BAUD_RATE): Use CDL option for baud rate.

	* cdl/hal_powerpc_quicc.cdl: Add option to control diag serial
	baud rate, rather than being fixed at 38400.

end-serialize-newcdl
2000-02-21  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (UART_BIT_RATE): Handle system clock speeds
	which are not integer multiples of MHz, e.g. 33.33 MHz.

2000-02-04  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_quicc_smc1_uart_rcvchar): Get frequency
	from new CYGHWR_HAL_POWERPC_BOARD_SPEED variable.

1999-09-02  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (init_smc1_uart): Generalize baud rate computation.

1999-09-01  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/ppc8xx.h: Add some missing definitions (MAR, MBMR).

1999-06-27  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Many changes which allow these routines to
	cooperate when the SMC is being used by a serial "driver" as well.
	In particular, remove "hard coded" resources on the SMC.
	Note: there is some lingering problem with the transmit routines
	[globally] after the serial driver re-inits the SMC.  Of course
	this problem is intermittent, so it's hard to fix.

1999-06-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_hal_gdb_isr): Add this routine to trap ^C
	events and stop the system, if CYGDBG_HAL_DEBUG_GDB_BREAK_SUPPORT.

1999-06-24  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (cyg_quicc_init_smc1): Remove unused, commented
	out code, that was left over from CygMon version of this file.

1999-06-18  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (init_smc1_uart): Use default 38400 Baud,
	because it is better.

1999-06-18  Jesper Skov  <jskov@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c (init_smc1_uart): Initialize the baud rate
	depending on the system clock setting.

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Moved include of ppc8xx.h

	* src/ppc8xx.h: Removed, to...

	* include/ppc8xx.h: New file.  Moved here so that platform startup
	code can share it.

1999-06-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* src/quicc_smc1.c: Make this file safe for compilation even when
	no PowerPC 860 is in use; pkgconf can enable this component for
	any target, potentially.

1999-06-10  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@cygnus.co.uk>

	* ChangeLog: Component created, based partly on the FADS work and
	on CygMon's serial IO code for the MBX860, to support the Motorola
	MBX860 QUICC serial controller for basic IO.
	Initially only used in the neighbouring platform component
	HAL_POWERPC_MBX [hal/powerpc/mbx/....]
