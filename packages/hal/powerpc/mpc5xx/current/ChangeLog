    * include/var_intr.h:
    * include/var_intr.c: 

    Corrected some interrupt priority level defines used by asserts.
    Changed confusing SCI0/1 naming to SCI1/2 to be consistent with actual 
    register names. 
    Removed some SCI related interrupt acknowledges so that the status 
    is preserved for the DSR.

    * include/var_intr.h: Fixed a set of incorrect asserts.

2004-04-22  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	 * cdl/hal_powerpc_mpc5xx.cdl :
	 Invoke tail with stricter syntax that works in latest coreutils. 

2004-04-21  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* src/var_intr.c: 
	* include/var_regs.h: Changes to allow compilation with latest GCC.

2003-11-30  Bob Koninckx  <bob.koninckx@fmtc.be>

    * include/var_intr.h: Added definitions for maximum/minimum interrupt
      priorites on SIU/IMB3

2002-11-11  Bob Koninckx  <bob.koninckx@mech.kuleuven.ac.be>

    * include/var_regs.h: Removed double definitions for ICTRL, ICTRL_SERSHOW
    and ICTRL_NOSERSHOW
    * src/var_intr.c: Added a very simple serial arbitration isr to make GDB-CTRC
    work in the absence of any device drivers.
    * include/var_intr.h: Added a definition for hal_arbitration_isr_sci
    * include/variant.inc: Make sure FREEZE gets negated before returning from an
    exception. Failing to do so prevents proper operation of timers etc when
    debugging.
    * tests/intr0.c: completely rewritten to something that actually tests something.
    Not completely finished.
