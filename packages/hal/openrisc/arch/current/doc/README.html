  <title>README - eCos OpenRISC Port</title>
   
</head>
<body>
 For those unfamiliar with OpenRISC, it is an open-source RISC/DSP processor 
architecture. &nbsp;OpenCores.org makes available an <a
 href="http://www.opencores.org/projects/or1k">implementation</a> of this 
architecture that can be synthesized, for example, as part of an FPGA or ASIC.
&nbsp;The port of eCos to OpenRISC was sponsored by the <a
 href="http://www.rosum.com">Rosum Corporation</a>.<br>
 <br>
 A few notes and caveats about the eCos OpenRISC port: 
<ul>
   <li>The only platform supported at this time is ORP (OpenRISC Reference 
Platform).</li>
   <li>The only ORP devices supported so far are serial ports used for  
  diagnostic and debugging purposes and AM29LVxxxx Flash ROM.</li>
   <li>To build and debug, you must build the GNU development tools from
    <a
 href="#%20http://www.opencores.org/projects/or1k/GNU%20Toolchain%20Port">source 
available at the OpenCores web site</a> -- not the versions      available 
from the GNU  web site or elsewhere. &nbsp;There is a <a
 href="./build_or32_elf_tools.sh">shell script</a> in this directory that 
will assist in downloading     and building the GNU toolchain.</li>
   <li>For debugging, you can use either gdb's JTAG target or the serial
    target.  The latter has some advantages, e.g. the gdb serial target is
thread-aware, but it is much slower, especially while     simulating.<br>
