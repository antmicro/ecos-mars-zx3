	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_lpc24xx_ea2468_rom.ldi:
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_lpc24xx_ea2468_ram.ldi: Relocate fixed
	vectors to 0x40000020. Previously, the HAL_VSR_GET/SET macros
	accessed the wrong locations and didn't have any effect; now both
	hardware and software have the same idea of where the VSR table
	is.
	NOTE: that this renders RAM applications built with this layout
	incompatible with RedBoot built with the old layout. A new RedBoot
	needs to be installed.

	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc24xx_ea2468.cdl:
	* tests/fiq.c: Add FIQ test program.

	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc24xx_ea2468.cdl: update compiler flags for gcc 4.x

2009-01-24  Bart Veer <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc24xx_ea2468.cdl: switch from arm-elf-gcc to
	arm-eabi-gcc. Remove -mno-short-load-words.

	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc24xx_ea2468.cdl: Fixed typo
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_lpc24xx_ea2468_ram.h: Reserve 1 MB of
          SDRAM for RedBoot.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_lpc24xx_ea2468_ram.ldi: Reserve 1 MB of
          SDRAM for RedBoot
	* src/platform_i2c.c: Compile only if I2C channel 0 is supported       

2008-09-18  Uwe Kindler  <uwe_kindler@web.de>

	* cdl/hal_arm_lpc2xxx_ea2468.cdl: Added compile platform_i2c.c and
	  CYGPKG_HAL_ARM_LPC24XX_EA2468_TESTS for building I2C test
	* include/plf_io.h: Exported I2C devices and bus via macro
	  HAL_I2C_EXPORTED_DEVICES, Added I2C related defines, Added
	  functions declarations  hal_lpc_eeprom_write() and 
	  hal_lpc_eeprom_read() for I2C EEPROM access
	* src/ea2468_misc.c: Replaced CYGARC_HAL_LPC24XX_SET_PIN_FUN() macro
	  calls with hal_set_pin_function() calls
	* src/platform_i2c.c: New file adds I2C bus support for I2C bus 0 and 
	  adds support for I2C EEPROM
	* tests/i2c_eeprom: Simple I2C EEPROM read/write test case
