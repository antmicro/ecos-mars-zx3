2009-01-24  Bart Veer <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_e7t.cdl: switch from arm-elf-gcc to
	arm-eabi-gcc. Remove -mno-short-load-words.

2009-01-08  John Dallaway  <john@dallaway.org.uk>

	* src/flash_cksum.tcl: Specify script interpreter via /usr/bin/env.

2004-04-22  Jani Monoses <jani@iv.ro>

	 * cdl/hal_arm_e7t.cdl :
	 Invoke tail with stricter syntax that works in latest coreutils. 

2003-12-05  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/hal_diag.h: hal_delay_us is a C function.
	
2003-11-05  Roland Caﬂebohm  <roland.cassebohm@visionsystems.de>

        * include/plf_io.h: Define HAL_IO_MACROS_NO_ADDRESS_MUNGING to
        force the IO macros not to mung the addresses. This platform
        don't need this.

2003-10-06  Chris Garry  <cgarry@sweeneydesign.co.uk>

        * include/plf_io.h: Correct (unused) defines for
        E7T_ROMCON_BASE_MASK and E7T_ROMCON_NEXT_MASK.

2003-09-21  Gary Thomas  <gary@mlbassoc.com>

	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm:  Adjust for changes in RedBoot
	template - DNS now must be enabled manually.

2003-07-18  Nick Garnett  <nickg@balti.calivar.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_e7t.cdl:
        Changed values for CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_NUMERATOR,
        CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_DENOMINATOR and CYGNUM_HAL_RTC_PERIOD to
        "default_value" from "calculated". This makes it easier
        to change these values globally.
        
2003-02-05  Nick Garnett  <nickg@calivar.com>

	* include/plf_io.h (CYGARC_PHYSICAL_ADDRESS): Added this
	definition to keep redboot_linux_exec.c happy.

2003-01-29  John Dallaway  <jld@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/flash_cksum.tcl: Accommodate latest Cygwin Tcl shell
	(tclsh83.exe)

2002-10-19  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Only define if
	ROM or ROMRAM, not if STUBS which can be RAM.

2002-04-15  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Changed ldm/stm
	to ldmia/stmia.

2002-03-06  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: Added zlib package.

2001-10-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_e7t.cdl (CYGBLD_BUILD_REDBOOT_BIN): cygtclsh80 on
	Cygwin can't deal with absolute paths correctly, so copy
	flash_cksum.tcl into build directory.

2001-07-02  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/hal_diag.c (cyg_hal_plf_serial_getc_nonblock): Ack RX
	interrupt after reading.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_e7t_ram.mlt: Reserve 64kB for RedBoot.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_e7t_ram.ldi: Same.

	* src/hal_diag.c: Make some data type fixes. Try to ack interrupt
	after reading data. Unable to test though due to some other
	problem on diag output.

2001-04-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_e7t.cdl: Fix compiler flags. In particular, do now
	allow unaligned access since the CPU doesn't handle it.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h (PLATFORM_SETUP1): Use proper
	spells to init memory interface.

	* src/e7t_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Removed debug code, fix
	cache init code.

	* include/plf_io.h: Use uncached addresses for IO registers.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Found a hint for problems with
	memory init.

	* include/hal_cache.h (HAL_UCACHE_INVALIDATE_ALL): Tried to make
	this a bit faster. Didn't help much though.

	* src/hal_diag.c (cyg_hal_plf_serial_init): Remove unused variable.

2001-04-16  Gary Thomas  <gthomas@redhat.com>

	* cdl/hal_arm_e7t.cdl: Add CDL to describe CPU family.

2001-04-11  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/e7t_misc.c (hal_delay_us): Fixed.

	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_e7t_rom.ldi: Updated.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_e7t_rom.mlt: Same.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_e7t_rom.h:   Same.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_e7t_ram.ldi: Updated.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_e7t_ram.mlt: Same.
	* include/pkgconf/mlt_arm_e7t_ram.h:   Same.

2001-04-05  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: Only read from debug port.

	* src/redboot_module.c: Fail if attempted built in wrong config.

	* src/e7t_misc.c (hal_IRQ_handler): Fixed comparisons.

2001-03-19  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/e7t_misc.c (hal_delay_us): Made it work. Not sure why the
	interrupts don't actually fire. This will probably break when that
	gets sorted out later.

	* src/hal_diag.c (cyg_hal_plf_serial_getc_nonblock): Rename a
	register.

	* src/e7t_misc.c (hal_hardware_init): Init caches, clear global
	interrupt mask flag.
	(hal_delay_us): Added.

	* include/plf_io.h: Added cache definitions.

	* include/hal_diag.h (HAL_DELAY_US): Added.

	* include/hal_cache.h: Rewrote for KS32C50100.

	* misc/redboot_ROM.ecm: Added.

	* src/redboot_module.c: Added.
	* src/gdb_module.c: Removed.

	* src/e7t_misc.c: Comment out test code, but keep it around for
	now.

	* cdl/hal_arm_e7t.cdl: Added RedBoot build magic. Removed stubs
	build magic.

	* include/hal_platform_setup.h: Set PIO directions and IO
	widths. The rest cannot be set wo hanging the board.

	* src/hal_diag.c: Baud rate is computed from 1/2 core clock. All
	register access is 32 bit. Added simple functions to print out
	values without use of RAM.
	Enabling TX/RX means allowing interrupts. Rely on vector mask only
	for controlling ctrl-c interrupts.

2001-03-16  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/e7t_misc.c: Rewrote timer and interrupt code for
	E7T. Removed reset code.

	* include/plf_io.h: Added interrupt controller and timer
	registers.

	* include/hal_platform_ints.h: Updated interrupt defintions to
	match E7T. No reset magic.

	* src/hal_diag.c: Use correct interrupt definitions.

	* Cloned from AEB HAL.
