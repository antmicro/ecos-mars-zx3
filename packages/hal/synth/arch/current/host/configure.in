dnl The current version of the synthetic target is implemented only for
dnl x86 Linux platforms, so a test is appropriate here. However
dnl it is not a good idea for the configure script to report an error:
dnl that would prevent any top-level configury working for other
dnl platforms. Instead an automake conditional is used to suppress adding
dnl targets to the build.
