	* include/memjoin.inl: Fix compiler warning about variable that
	is set but never referenced when CYG_ASSERT isn't used.

2012-03-06  Grant Edwards <grant.b.edwards@gmail.com>

	* src/malloc.cxx (free):
	* src/kapi.cxx (cyg_mempool_var_free, cyg_mempool_fix_free): Fix
	compiler warnings about variables that are set but never
	referenced. [ Bugzilla 1001511 ]

2009-09-01  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/heapgen.tcl (tcl_path): use the makefile's HOST instead of
	tcl_platform() to figure out host details.

2009-06-24  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/malloc.cxx (cyg_memalloc_heap_reinit): Added this function
	to reinitialize the heap to a new arena. This should be done
	during system startup and is present mainly for the use of
	RedBoot.
	Permit configurations with multi-region heaps to build.
	[Imported from eCosPro sources, mainly to support use of
	filesystems in RedBoot].
	
2009-02-03  Simon Kallweit  <simon.kallweit@intefo.ch>

	* include/mvarimpl.inl:
	* include/sepmetaimpl.inl:

	* src/dlmalloc.cxx (MALLOC_COPY): Reinstate fix of 2008-01-06
	(reverting change of 2008-11-03).
	* cdl/memalloc.cdl (CYGIMP_MEMALLOC_ALLOCATOR_DLMALLOC_USE_MEMCPY):
	Make explicit dependency on isoinfra functionality block which
	includes memmove(), and set default_value accordingly.

2008-11-03  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* src/dlmalloc.cxx (MALLOC_COPY): Replace memmove() with memcpy().

	* include/dlmallocimpl.hxx (class Cyg_Mempool_dlmalloc_Implementation):
	Remove spurious typedef in definition of struct malloc_chunk.

2008-01-06  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/dlmalloc.cxx (MALLOC_COPY): 
	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Use memmove instead of memcpy which can go
	wrong in realloc() when the new and old block overlaps.
	CYGIMP_MEMALLOC_ALLOCATOR_DLMALLOC_USE_MEMCPY has been retained
	instead of being renamed to ..._MEMMOVE to help backward
	compatibility with older configurations. Thanks to Oyvind Harboe
	and Dave Lawrence.

2007-11-05  Oyvind Harboe <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>
	
	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Added option CYGBLD_MEMALLOC_MALLOC_EXTERNAL_JOIN_H

2007-10-24  Oyvind Harboe <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>
2007-10-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* src/malloc.cxx: Init priority for pool initialization is now
	CYG_INIT_MEMALLOC instead of before CYG_INIT_LIBC
	* src/heapgen.tcl: Ditto.

2006-05-17  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* doc/memalloc.sgml: Fix parameters for calloc. Reported by
	Andy Jackson.

2005-09-30  Alexander Neundorf <neundorf@kde.org>

        * doc/memalloc.sgml: two minor fixes

2005-07-30  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* tests/heaptest.c (test_pat): Casts to prevent compiler warnings.

2005-07-22  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Use the CXXFLAGS for the native compiler to
	avoid passing it flags only valid for C.

2005-03-27  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Added reference to documentation
	* doc/memalloc.sgml: Basic user documentation.
	* tests/heaptest.c (test_pat): Fix compiler error with 
	  diag_printf.

2004-10-04  Oyvind Harboe  <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* src/dlmalloc.cxx (resize_alloc): No longer invoke
	 cyg_memalloc_alloc_fail() on failure to resize. It is not an out
	 of memory condition, it just means the current memory allocation
	 could not be expanded. realloc() will try allocating a completely
	 new block of memory and only if that fails do we have an out of
	 memory condition.

2004-10-01  Oyvind Harboe  <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* heapgen.tcl: place the CYGBLD_ATTRIB_INIT_PRI such that it
	compiles for gcc 3.4.2 which is more picky about its placement.

2004-06-24  Oyvind Harboe  <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* Added cyg_memalloc_alloc_fail() fn which is invoked before 
	return NULL from failed allocations. Useful breakpoint site.
	Andrew Lunn wrote some of the code and pointed out various
	wrinkles to be ironed out.

2004-02-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/kapi.h: Add throw specifications throughout.
	* src/kapi.cxx: Ditto.

	compiler warning added by previous patch.

2003-09-30  Eric Doenges <Eric.Doengea@DynaPel.com>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl, src/dlmalloc.cxx: Make the minimum memory
	alignment a configuration option for Doug Lea's memory allocator.

2002-04-24  Yoshinori Sato  <qzb04471@nifty.ne.jp>

	* src/memfixed.cxx (resize_alloc): Don't set default args in func
	definition.

2002-01-30  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx:
	Never call realloc() with a new size of 0, which frees the buffer.
	Fix the volatility of ptr.p

2002-01-23  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx (myrand): Fix overflow.

2002-01-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx (myrand): Fix so that it really treats the limit
	as a limit.

	check_alloced_memdq as inlines.

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Add new allocator supporting separate metadata,
	and the associated config options, and build sepmeta.cxx and tests.
	Build heapgeninc.tcl with macros that work with both gcc2 and gcc3.
	Ditto for heaps.o.
	Add CYGBLD_MEMALLOC_MALLOC_EXTERNAL_HEAP_H to allow external entities

	* src/malloc.cxx: Include CYGBLD_MEMALLOC_MALLOC_EXTERNAL_HEAP_H if
	defined instead of default heap definition.
	* include/sepmeta.hxx, include/sepmetaimpl.hxx, include/sepmetaimpl.inl,
	src/sepmeta.cxx, tests/sepmeta1.cxx, tests/sepmeta2.cxx:
	New files for seperated metadata allocator.

2001-07-18  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Use constructor priority of CYG_INIT_MEMALLOC
	for heap objects in generated heaps.cxx.

2001-07-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/malloc2.c (cyg_start): Ditto.
	* tests/malloc3.c (cyg_start): Ditto.
	* tests/malloc4.cxx (cyg_start): Ditto. Also add DEBUGTEST define
	and fix comment.

	* tests/testaux.hxx (STACKSIZE): Double.

2001-05-02  Hugo Tyson  <hmt@redhat.com>

	* src/dlmalloc.cxx (Cyg_Mempool_dlmalloc_Implementation): Fix
	previous change; "top" is a pseudo variable via a NULL pointer if
	the heap is not initialized, so you can't use it as a flag for "no
	mem here"; and a typo, the comparison was reversed.  The two hid
	each other, so the check for "no mem here" usually said "OK".

2001-05-01  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/mvarimpl.inl (try_alloc): Allow zero sized heaps.
	(Cyg_Mempool_Variable_Implementation): Ditto.

	* tests/malloc4.cxx: Use semaphores to sync startup order.

2000-11-28  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* src/heapgen.tcl: Don't use cygpath -s for now as not all cygwins
	have it yet.

2000-11-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Make sure PWD variable doesn't clash with bash PWD
	by renaming to XPWD

2000-11-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl: Invoke heapgen.tcl with build directory
	surrounded by quotes (and do so in a portable way).

	* cdl/memalloc.cdl (CYGSEM_MEMALLOC_MALLOC_ZERO_RETURNS_NULL): 
	New option.
	* src/malloc.cxx (malloc): Use above option to decide if NULL should
	be returned on malloc(0).

2000-11-01  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/realloc.c (main): Use reasonable factor when making too
	large realloc (targets with 64MB would cause an overflow).

2000-10-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* tests/testaux.hxx: Prototype cyg_hal_invoke_constructors()
	[ Forgot to check this in at the same time as below ]

	* tests/dlmalloc2.cxx:
	* tests/malloc4.cxx:
	* tests/memfix1.cxx:
	* tests/memfix2.cxx:
	* tests/memvar1.cxx:
	* tests/memvar2.cxx:
	Make sure default priority constructors have been invoked.

2000-09-14  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* tests/realloc.c (main): fix warning.
	* tests/malloc1.c (main): Same.
	* tests/malloc2.c (main): Same.
	* tests/malloc3.c (main): Same.

2000-08-31  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	var in each thread.

2000-07-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* tests/malloc4.cxx (thrfree): Get mem size here. Tidy output.

	Created as new package, merging existing memory allocator related stuff
	from the kernel and libc. Many bug fixes to existing stuff, as
	well as performance improvements, and extra features such as
	a port of dlmalloc, and the ability to support multiple disjoint
	heaps, possibly with run-time configurable size.
	There's even a bit of documentation, and some new tests
