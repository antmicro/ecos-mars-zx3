	* src/objelf.c:cyg_ldr_relocate_section(): Conditional block did
	shadow the return of error code. Fixed.

2010-03-03  Stanislav Karpenko  <s.o.karpenko@gmail.com>

	* include/objelf.h: Add missed entry to CYG_LDR_TABLE_KAPI_MUTEX
	definition (cyg_mutex_lock_entry).

2009-10-09  John Dallaway  <john@dallaway.org.uk>

	* cdl/objloader.cdl: Eliminate workarounds for file path handling
	issue in obsolete Cygwin tclsh. Use ACTUAL_CFLAGS for robustness.

2009-09-13  Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>

	* src/objloader.c, src/objelf.c, include/objelf.h : Fixed a memory
	leak where a library section was loaded but memory allocated was not
	released. This bug was reported by Davy Wouters on the eCos list.
	Added minor cosmetics and a number of CYG_ASSERT and if() to test the
	values returnedby cyg_ldr_load_elf_section().

2009-07-03  John Dallaway  <john@dallaway.org.uk>

	* cdl/objloader.cdl, src/objelf.c, src/relocate_ppc.c,
	  src/relocate_arm.c: Eliminate dependency on CYGPKG_IO_FILEIO when
	the filesystem loader is not required.

2009-02-07  John Dallaway  <john@dallaway.org.uk>

	* cdl/objloader.cdl: Pass file2c.tcl to tclsh directly.

2008-12-01  Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>
    * src/relocate_arm.c : Added relocation software for the ARM .
    * src/relocate_i386.c : Added a structure containing the relocation names
    for every architecture. Only used (and compiled in) for pretty printing.
    * src/relocate_ppc.c : 
    * include/relocate_arm.h : New header file for src/relocate_arm.c
    * cdl/objloader.cdl: Added the option to relocate for the ARM.
    * src/objloader.c :
    * src/objelf.c : Erased some redundant debug printout and improved the
    readability of the rest.
    
2008-12-01  Gernot Zankl  <gernot.zankl@gmx.at>
    * src/loader_memory.c : Added the code to allow the objloader package
    to load libraries from ROM memory, instead from a file system. The various
    sections of the library are the copied from ROM to RAM and relocated.
    * include/loader_memory.h : New header file for src/loader_memory.c
    * src/objloader.c : Added a line to include the loader_memory header
    file and code to flush the cache when calling cyg_ldr_find_symbol().
    * cdl/objloader.cdl: Added one check boxe for each of the supported ways
    of loading libraries (two for now) so that the user can compile out the
    loading methods not used.

2006-06-27  Anthony Tonizzo  <atonizzo@gmail.com>
    * src/loader_fs.c : Minor cosmetic and formatting changes on all files. 
    Also got rid of some signed/unsigned comparison which did not show up using
    the PPC toolchain but do when compiled with gcc under the synthetic target.
    * src/objelf.c :    
    * src/objloader.c :
    * src/relocate_i386.c : 
    * src/relocate_ppc.c : 
    * include/elf.h :
    * include/loader_fs.h :
    * include/objelf.h :
    * include/relocate_i386.h : 
    * include/relocate_ppc.h : 
    * test/test_mods.c : 
    * test/library/hello.c : 
    
2005-07-08  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

    * include/objelf.h: Include hal_tables.h otherwise we get strange
    linker errors.
    * cdl/objloader.cdl: Rearranged the building of the test case.
    * include/relocate_i386.h (New):
    * src/relocate_i386.c (New): Added a relocator for i386.
    * src/objelf.c: Fixed various Elf_Rel vs Elf_Rela issues.
    * test/load_mods.c: 
    * test/library/hello.c: Modified to make use of the eCos test 
    infrastructure. Uses a romfs to hold the object file to be loaded.
