	a logo file when there is a file system. Don't bother
	with touchscreen calibration on a PC without a
	touch-sensitive screen.

	* src/drivers/ps2kbdmou_ecos.c:

	(main): renamed to app_main.

2002-03-27  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* src/drivers/scr_ecos.c (gen_getscreeninfo): Fill in correct
	color layout based on pixel format. Now the animation renders
	correctly.

	* drivers/scr_ecos.c (gen_getscreeninfo): Fill in all
	parameters. At least the missing potrait mode cause
	problems. fbdriver parameter is probably wrong, but needs to be
	non-zero.

2002-03-26  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/microwindows.cdl: Renamed CYGBLD_MICROWINDOWS_ARM9_DRIVERS

	src/include directory to include/microwin.

	testing.
	
2002-03-22  Bart Veer  <bartv@redhat.com>

	* Configs/config.ecosvga:
	New config file for eCos on a PC using the VGA driver.

	* Arc.rules, makefile.rules, config, */Makefile */*/Makefile
	Add build support for x86 eCos, and allow builds outside the
	source tree.
	
	* nanox/clientfb.c:
	Only assume LCD display when compiling for ARM.
	<cyg/hal/lcd_support.h> etc. do not exist when building for PC.

	* ecos/ecos_app.c:
	Add missing #include's
	Fix type ecos_nx_setup() vs. ecos_nx_init()

	* drivers/vgaplan4.h:
	Define the appropriate out?() macros for eCos

	* drivers/vgainit.c:
	Set up to access hardware directly. 
	Use HAL macro to peek I/O port
	Fix one of the initial values for the VGA registers, which I
	believe was leaving all planes disabled.
	
	* drivers/scr_ecos.c:
	This is not used by all eCos targets, e.g. PC using the
	microwindows VGA driver. For now conditionalize on CYGPKG_HAL_ARM. 

	* drivers/memplan4.c, drivers/scr_bios.c, 
	Set up to access hardware directly under eCos.

	* drivers/kbd_null.c:
