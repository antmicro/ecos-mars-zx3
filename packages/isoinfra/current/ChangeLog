	CYGINT_ISO_EXIT. CYGINT_ISO_EXIT configuration variable is always
	defined to either 0 or 1, so check of the former form is always
	evaluated to true.
					 
2005-10-20  Alexander Neundorf <neundorf@kde.org>
	    Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/sys/time.h (new): Basic implementation.

2004-03-30  Alex Paulis and Cameron Taylor  <ctaylor@waverider.com>

	* include/sys/select.h: set FD_SETSIZE to CYGNUM_FILEIO_NFD
	when appropriate.

2004-03-12  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Typo: CYGBLD_ISO_STDIO_FILEPOS ->
	CYGBLD_ISO_STDIO_FILEPOS_HEADER.

	* include/limits.h: Avoid potential illegal recursion if
	already been included by GCC's limits.h.

	* include/stdio.h: Include stdarg.h to save duplication.
	Give fileno(),fdopen() throw specifiers.

	* include/unistd.h: Prototype for rename() lives in stdio.h.

2004-01-07  Jonathan Larmour  <jifl@eCosCentric.com>

	* include/sys/select.h: Only declare pselect() when posix signals are
	included.

2003-07-15  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/sys/stat.h (S_ISGID): Please, somebody teach me to count!

2003-07-10  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/sys/stat.h :S_I[RWX]{USR|GRP|OTH} etc changed so they
	don't overlap with S_ISLINK and S_ISSOCK. Reported by Scott
	Wilkinson.

2003-06-10  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/sys/stat.h: S_IFFIFO defies logic and should be called
	S_IFIFO!

2003-05-26  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/sys/stat.h (S_IF*): Added macros to test the type of a
	file.

	mq_timedreceive() functions.

2002-12-12  Bart Veer  <bartv@ecoscentric.com>

	* include/stdlib.h: #include cyg_type.h, now that this header
	uses NORET attributes

2002-11-10  Nick Garnett  <nickg@ecoscentric.com>

	* include/sys/types.h: Add define/undefine for __NEED_FD_SETS_ONLY
	around include of sys/select.h to avoid circular dependencies in
	headers.

	* include/sys/select.h: Reorganized definitions so that the
	include from sys/types.h only defines the fd_set type and macros
	and not the select() and pselect() functions. The latter needs
	sigset_t from signal.h, which can result in circularity.

2002-04-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/stdlib.h: use NORET attributes from cyg_type.h.

2002-03-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/float.h: Don't have multiple inclusion protection. It is
	unnecessary and can confuse things if the headers are subject to two
	-I paths.
	* include/stdarg.h: Ditto.
	* include/float.h: Don't cover include_next with inclusion protection
	for a similar reason.
	* include/stddef.h: Use C comment.

2002-01-17  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/unistd.h: ftruncate() should use an off_t argument.

2002-01-15  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/sys/types.h: off_t should be signed.

2001-12-05  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/netdb.h (gethostbyname): anonymous arguments aren't allowed
	in C (I thought they were a GNU C extension, sigh).

2001-11-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>
2001-11-30  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* include/netdb.h: Provide a default NULL implementation of
	struct hostent, gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr if a real implementation
	doesn't exist. This makes life easier for legacy code.

2001-10-17  Jesper Skov  <jskov@redhat.com>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Changed string interfaces to flavor booldata.

2001-09-10  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Add CYGINT_ISO_PTHREAD_MUTEX and
	CYGBLD_ISO_PTHREAD_MUTEX_HEADER.
	* include/pthread.h: Include above header if set.

2001-08-06  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Add a separate POSIX mutex types header option.
	* include/sys/types.h: Include it.
	* include/time.h: Provide a default struct timespec even if the
	implementation doesn't provide something better.

2001-07-26  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	* include/sys/types.h: Move select() related stuff into separate
	sys/select header. Include it still for now.

	* include/stdlib.h: Add code to set MB_CUR_MAX to __mb_cur_max
	if CYGFUN_LIBC_I18N_MB is defined, otherwise set it to 1.

2001-02-11  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

	NAME_MAX, PATH_MAX

2000-08-30  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/assert.h (assert): Fix logic

2000-08-29  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/stddef.h: Don't use CYGONCE_ multiple header inclusion
	protection for this file - this is special.

2000-08-08  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/limits.h: Add SSIZE_MAX

2000-08-03  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: CYGNUM_ISO_MQUEUE_OPEN_MAX and
	CYGNUM_ISO_MQUEUE_PRIO_MAX should only be active if CYGINT_ISO_MQUEUE
	rather than them requiring it

2000-07-20  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Added configury for sys/utsname.h.

	* include/unistd.h: Added _POSIX_VERSION constant.
	Changed return type of sysconf() to long.

	* include/sys/utsname.h: Added this file.

2000-07-13  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/unistd.h: Added fsync() prototype.

2000-07-13  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

2000-06-19  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Commented out requires line in
	CYGINT_POSIX_REALTIME_SIGNALS interface. This causes configuration
	errors when the POSIX package is absent.

	* include/sys/types.h: Reimplemented FD_COPY() and FD_ZERO() as
	inline copy loops rather than calls to memcpy() and memset(). 

2000-06-09  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/time.h: Following the below change, simply define struct
	timeval, while allowing it to be overridden if necessary
	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl (CYGBLD_ISO_STRUCTTIMEVAL_HEADER): define for this
	purpose

2000-06-09  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/time.h: Added definition of struct timeval. This is a
	temporary home for this while we work out where definitions like
	this should really live. Like the fd_set stuff in sys/types.h,
	this is needed by two packages, both of which can operate
	independently but which also need to co-operate when they are both
	present.

2000-06-07  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/sys/types.h: Added definitions for file descriptor sets
	and inclusion of BSD specific types.

	* include/stdlib.h: Added extern for environ variable in non-POSIX
	builds.

	* include/fcntl.h (O_WRONLY): Moved this to bit 1, leaving bit 2
	for future expansion.

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Added CYGPKG_ISO_EXTRA_TYPES to control
	inclusion of types into <sys/types.h> that are not specified by
	POSIX. Mostly needed by the socket and BSD code.

2000-06-02  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/unistd.h: Added this initial version of this file. Jifl
	will probably want to rewrite it at some point.

	* include/fcntl.h: Changed O_RDWR to (O_RDONLY|O_WRONLY).

2000-05-31  Nick Garnett  <nickg@cygnus.co.uk>

	* include/fcntl.h: Fixed ifdefs around extern declaration of
	fcntl().

2000-05-20  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/fcntl.h: new file
	* include/mqueue.h: new file
	* include/sys/stat.h: new file

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: No need for memcpy and memset interfaces - they're
	always present
	(CYGINT_ISO_POSIX_TIMERS): define _POSIX_TIMERS if enabled
	(CYGINT_POSIX_REALTIME_SIGNALS): add
	(CYGPKG_ISO_POSIX_FCNTL): Add a number of hooks for things that need
	to control fcntl.h
	(CYGPKG_ISO_MQUEUE): Add a number of hooks for things that need
	to control mqueue.h
	(CYGBLD_ISO_STAT_DEFS_HEADER): Add to override default sys/stat.h
	contents
	
	Fix some typos throughout, and a few other minor tidies
	
	* include/limits.h: Move _POSIX_* macros here from POSIX package since
	they are implementation independent

	* include/time.h: Keep CLOCKS_PER_SEC at 1000000

	* include/sys/types.h: Bring some of the types more in line with Linux

	* include/ctype.h, include/errno.h, include/limits.h, include/locale.h,
	include/pthread.h, include/sched.h, include/semaphore.h,
	include/setjmp.h, include/signal.h, include/stdio.h, include/stdlib.h,
	include/string.h, include/time.h, include/sys/types.h:
	Don't need to explicitly check interface values > 0

2000-05-02  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.co.uk>

	* include/time.h: Provide default definitions of time_t, clock_t and
	CLOCKS_PER_SEC

	* cdl/isoinfra.cdl: Remove CYGINT_ISO_TIME_T and CYGINT_ISO_CLOCK_T -
	not really needed with a default definition

	* New package isoinfra with the following files:
	include/errno.h
	include/sys/types.h
	include/assert.h
	include/stddef.h
	include/string.h
	include/setjmp.h
	include/ctype.h
	include/float.h
	include/sched.h
	include/stdarg.h
	include/semaphore.h
	include/time.h
	include/signal.h
	include/locale.h
	include/pthread.h
	include/stdio.h
	include/stdlib.h
	include/limits.h
	cdl/isoinfra.cdl

	This package manages the ISO standard (C and POSIX) top-level header
	files
